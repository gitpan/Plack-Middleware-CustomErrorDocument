NAME
    Plack::Middleware::CustomErrorDocument - dynamically select error
    documents based on HTTP status code

VERSION
    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
        # in app.psgi

        $app = Plack::Middleware::CustomErrorDocument->wrap(
            $app,
            # dynamic $path (set according to $env):
            404 => sub {
                my $env = shift;
                ...
                return $path;
            },
            # use static path
            500 => 'path/to/error/doc',
        );

        # or with Plack::Builder:
        builder {
            enable "Plack::Middleware::CustomErrorDocument",
                404 => sub {
                ...;
            };
            $app;
        };

        # subrequests are possible, as with Plack::Middleware::ErrorDocument
        # (but untested and unrecommended)
        $app = Plack::Middleware::CustomErrorDocument->wrap(
            $app,
            404 => sub {
                my $env = shift;
                ...
                return $path;
            },
            subrequest => 1,
        );

DESCRIPTION
    Dynamically select an appropriate error document for an HTTP status
    error code. Pass in a subroutine coderef, which should take $env as the
    sole argument, and return the destination file path as a string.

    An example use would be to return a 'missing' image file for image
    requests that result in a 404 status (and a standard 404 HTML page for
    all others).
